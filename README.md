Designed and developed an Open-Type Dust Cleaner with Bag Filter, creating 3D CAD models of components like filters, pipes, and motor enclosures in SolidWorks.

Conducted advanced simulations, including static load analysis and motion studies, to validate structural reliability and optimize system performance.

Improved dust collection efficiency through iterative design refinements and analysis of material properties for durability under operational loads.

Collaborated with team members to integrate subsystems into a cohesive design and validated assembly fit and functionality using SolidWorks tools.

Documented the design process and simulation outcomes, gaining hands-on experience in optimization, simulation, and troubleshooting of filtration systems.
